# Troubleshooting Git Command Output Capture Issues

## Problem Overview
When executing Git commands in the terminal, output from some commands may not be captured.
This is due to technical limitations and is particularly likely to occur with the following commands:

- `git fetch`
- `git log`
- `git diff` (when there are large diffs)

## Solutions

### 1. Using Alternative Commands

#### Checking Commit Count
```bash
# Regular command (output may not be captured)
git log HEAD..origin/branch-name --oneline

# Alternative command (get results as numerical values)
git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/branch-name
```

#### Checking Branch Information
```bash
# Regular command
git status -sb

# Alternative command
git branch -vv
```

#### Checking Differences
```bash
# Regular command (when there is large output)
git diff

# Alternative command (statistics only)
git diff --stat
# Or check per specific file
git diff path/to/file
```

### 2. Best Practices for Verification Procedures

1. **First try regular commands**
   - In most cases, they work normally

2. **Use alternative commands when output cannot be captured**
   - Refer to the alternative command list above

3. **When detailed information is needed**
   - Request from the user as follows:
   ```
   The terminal output could not be captured.
   Could you please copy and paste the output directly from the terminal?
   ```

### 3. Specific Usage Examples

#### Checking Synchronization with Remote
```bash
# Check if local is behind remote
git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/branch-name

# Check if local is ahead of remote
git rev-list --count origin/branch-name..HEAD

# If result is 0, then synchronized; if 1 or more, there are differences
```

#### Checking Branch Tracking Status
```bash
# List of remote branches
git branch -r

# Search for specific branch
git branch -r | grep branch-name
```

## Important Notes

- Even if a command displays "succeeded," the output may not be captured
- When important information is needed, always ask the user for confirmation
- When alternative commands provide sufficient information, use them preferentially
- **When deleting remote branches, check beforehand if they are set as the default branch on GitHub.** Default branches are protected, so attempting to delete them directly will result in an error.
