# IT Training Material Style Guide

This document provides guidelines for the style of IT training materials (Slidev and Markdown formats). The objective is to standardize the quality of materials and provide content that is easy for learners to understand and consistent.

## 1. Design Rules

### 1.1. Fonts

*   **Slidev:** The font family to be used will be specified separately according to the training theme and target audience. Highly readable universal design fonts are recommended.
*   **Markdown:** Standard web fonts will be used. Monospaced fonts will be used for code blocks.

### 1.2. Color Palette

*   **Slidev:** Define and consistently use a main color, sub-color, and accent color throughout the materials. Color combinations should consider visibility and accessibility.
*   **Markdown:** Colors may be used sparingly for purposes such as syntax highlighting in code blocks or drawing attention to important points.

### 1.3. Layout

*   **Slidev:** The arrangement of elements on each slide should be designed to organize information and clarify visual hierarchy. Use appropriate spacing to avoid overcrowding elements.
*   **Markdown:** Use heading levels appropriately to make the structure of the content clear. Utilize bullet points and numbered lists.

### 1.4. Insertion of Diagrams and Images

*   Diagrams and images are used to supplement explanations and aid understanding.
*   Use high-resolution images with clear content.
*   Respect copyright and clearly indicate sources.
*   In Slidev, arrange diagrams and images so they do not disrupt the slide layout. Actively utilize text-based diagrams like Mermaid.

## 2. Writing Rules

### 2.1. Tone and Language

*   **Polite Tone:** Maintain a polite and formal tone ("です・ます" style in Japanese output) throughout the materials.
*   **Consideration for IT Beginners:** When using technical terms, always provide easy-to-understand explanations. Utilize analogies and examples to explain abstract concepts concretely. **The level of explanation should aim to be understandable by high school students without special prior knowledge.**
*   **Positive Language:** Choose positive and clear language to enhance learners' motivation.

### 2.2. Handling of Technical Terms

*   When a technical term appears for the first time, provide a simple explanation on the spot or in a separate glossary.
*   When using abbreviations, include the full term the first time they appear.

### 2.3. Code Block Formatting

*   Apply syntax highlighting to code blocks according to the programming or markup language used.
*   Follow general coding conventions for indentation and spacing.
*   Provide clear explanations for code, either before or after the code block, or as comments within the code.

### 2.4. Use of Markdown Syntax

*   Appropriately use standard Markdown syntax such as headings, bold text, italics, lists, links, and code blocks to structure the document and improve readability.
*   Effectively utilize tables and footnotes to organize information.

## 3. Structure Rules

### 3.1. Slide Structure

*   Each slide should contain one main message or topic.
*   Slide titles should be concise and accurately represent the content.
*   Avoid overcrowding slides with too much information to prevent visual burden.

### 3.2. Text Document Structure

*   Organize content into chapters and sections following a logical flow.
*   Provide headings at the beginning of each chapter and section to summarize the content.
*   Emphasize important points using bold text or bullet points.

### 3.3. Exercises

*   Exercises should be appropriately placed to reinforce learning.
*   Exercise content should be clear and at a level suitable for IT beginners.
*   Clearly state the objective of the exercise and the expected outcome.

## 4. Other

*   Thoroughly proofread the materials to eliminate typos and grammatical errors.
*   Anticipate potential questions from learners and prepare supplementary explanations or reference materials.
*   Manage material versions appropriately.
