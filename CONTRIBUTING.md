# Contributing to prompts (Custom .clinerules Repository)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this repository! This is a fork of `cline/prompts` that serves as a centralized source for custom `.clinerules` files. This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively.

## üåü Welcome / „Çà„ÅÜ„Åì„Åù

This repository maintains AI assistant behavioral rules that can be selectively copied to other projects. We welcome contributions in both English and Japanese.

**Important**: All custom rules and contributions should target the `my-rules` branch, NOT `main`. The `main` branch is reserved for syncing with the upstream repository.

## üó£Ô∏è Language Guidelines

This project supports both English and Japanese. Here's when to use each:

### Use English for:
- Technical rules in `core-behavior/`, `coding/`, `tool/` directories
- Code comments and examples
- Git commit messages for technical changes
- API and function names

### Use Japanese for:
- Workflow documentation in `workflows/` directory
- Conceptual explanations
- Community discussions
- Git commit messages for Japanese documentation

### Bilingual Requirements:
- Tags should include both English and Japanese when relevant
- Example: `tags: ["mcp", "server", "obsidian", "troubleshooting", "„Éà„É©„Éñ„É´„Ç∑„É•„Éº„ÉÜ„Ç£„É≥„Ç∞"]`

## üìù Creating New Rules

### 1. **Planning Phase (PLAN Mode)**

Before creating a rule, consider:
- What problem does this rule solve?
- Which category does it belong to?
- Who is the target audience?
- Are there similar existing rules?

Open an issue to discuss if the rule:
- Introduces a new category
- Overlaps with existing rules
- Requires special considerations

### 2. **Create Your Feature Branch**

```bash
git checkout my-rules
git checkout -b feature/add-[rule-name]
```

### 3. **Rule File Structure**

All rule files MUST include YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: "Brief explanation of what this rule does"
author: "Your GitHub Username"
version: "1.0"
tags: ["relevant", "tags", "for", "categorization"]
globs: ["*.js", "*.ts"]  # File patterns where rule applies
---
# Rule Title

## Overview
Brief introduction to the rule's purpose.

## Guidelines

### MUST Requirements
- Use directive language: MUST, SHOULD, MAY, MUST NOT, NEVER
- Include practical examples
- Be specific and actionable

### Example
\```javascript
// Good example
const result = await processData(input);

// Bad example
const result = processData(input);  // Missing await
\```

## Additional Considerations
<thinking>
Complex logic explanations go here
</thinking>
```

### 4. **File Naming Conventions**

- Use kebab-case: `framework-name-guidelines.md`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include version if applicable: `laravel11-coding-guidelines.md`

### 5. **Update rules-manifest.json**

After creating your rule, update the manifest:

```bash
./scripts/update-manifest.sh
```

This automatically extracts metadata and updates the manifest file.

## üîÑ Updating Existing Rules

### 1. **Version Increment**

When updating a rule:
- Patch version (1.0 ‚Üí 1.1): Minor fixes, clarifications
- Minor version (1.1 ‚Üí 2.0): Significant changes, new sections

### 2. **Document Changes**

In your commit message or PR, clearly describe:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Any breaking changes

### 3. **Maintain Compatibility**

Consider existing users:
- Don't remove critical sections
- Add deprecation notices if needed
- Provide migration guidance

## üß™ Testing Your Changes

### 1. **Run Validation Scripts**

Always validate before submitting:

```bash
# Validate all rules and manifest consistency
./scripts/validate-rules.sh

# Update manifest if you added/modified rules
./scripts/update-manifest.sh
```

### 2. **Test in Real Projects**

- Copy your rule to an actual project's `.clinerules` directory
- Test with Cline/Claude to ensure it works as expected
- Document any issues or edge cases

### 3. **Check for Conflicts**

Ensure your rule doesn't conflict with:
- Existing rules in the same category
- Core Cline behaviors
- Common development practices

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Why use `my-rules` branch instead of `main`?
The `main` branch is kept in sync with the upstream `cline/prompts` repository. All custom rules should be added to `my-rules` to maintain clear separation.

### How do I sync with upstream changes?
```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

### What's the difference between this fork and the original?
This fork maintains custom rules on the `my-rules` branch while keeping `main` synchronized with upstream for easy updates.

### How are rules prioritized when multiple apply?
Rules are applied based on:
1. Glob pattern matching
2. Specificity (more specific patterns take precedence)
3. Load order (later rules can override earlier ones)

### Can I contribute rules in Japanese only?
Yes, but please include at least a brief English description in the frontmatter. The main content can be in Japanese for workflow-related rules.

## ü§≤ Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Provide constructive feedback
- Focus on improving AI assistant behaviors

### Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment or discrimination
